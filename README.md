# Multi-Aggregator Federated Learning Using Cartesi

## Project Overview

This project implements a multi-aggregator federated learning system using Cartesi's deterministic computational environment. The system aims to provide a verifiable and secure aggregation mechanism for federated learning by leveraging blockchain technology and Cartesi's ability to handle complex computations including floating-point operations.

## Key Features

- **Deterministic Computation**: Uses Cartesi's deterministic environment for consistent floating-point operations
- **Multi-Aggregator Design**: Supports multiple aggregators for enhanced security and reliability
- **Fraud Proof Mechanism**: Implements challenge-response verification for aggregation results
- **FedAvg Implementation**: Uses standard Federated Averaging as the aggregation algorithm
- **Flower Framework Integration**: Built on top of the Flower federated learning framework

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Cartesi Environment**: Provides deterministic computation for verifiable federated learning
2. **Smart Contracts**: Define the multi-aggregator rules and governance
3. **Flower Clients**: Participate in federated training with local data
4. **Aggregator Nodes**: Perform model aggregation in Cartesi environment
5. **Validation Mechanism**: Allow challenging and verification of aggregation results

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Local Setup with Cartesi CLI

- Install and configure Cartesi CLI
- Set up the local development environment
- Create and configure a Cartesi Machine with necessary ML libraries
- Deploy and test the local Cartesi node

### 2. Multi-Aggregator Contract and Logic

- Implement smart contracts for the federated learning protocol:
  - Client update submission
  - Random aggregator selection
  - Aggregation result submission
  - Challenge and verification mechanism
  - Rollback mechanism for invalid aggregations
  
- Track computation process in Cartesi for verification:
  - Record aggregation computation steps
  - Enable verification of floating-point operations
  - Support interactive dispute resolution

### 3. Federated Learning Simulation

- Set up Flower server and 20 Flower clients
- Implement FedAvg strategy for model aggregation
- Simulate multi-aggregator scenario:
  - Use different contract account addresses for each aggregation
  - Implement random selection of aggregator for each round
  - Support challenge and verification process
  - Demonstrate rollback on invalid aggregation

## Development Workflow

1. Set up the Cartesi environment and development tools
2. Implement and test the smart contracts
3. Develop the Flower integration with Cartesi
4. Implement the multi-aggregator simulation
5. Test the system under various scenarios
6. Evaluate performance and security

## Test Scenarios

1. **Normal Operation**: All aggregators behave honestly
2. **Byzantine Behavior**: Some aggregators submit incorrect results
3. **Challenge Mechanism**: Honest nodes challenge incorrect aggregations
4. **Rollback Procedure**: System correctly rolls back invalid results
